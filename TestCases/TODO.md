###Notes

I''m currently remodeling.  The following test cases work:
* allocate\_s
* dynallocate
* foreach
* gamma
* gaussian
* iterator
* partitionTest

The rest I''m still working on.  I''m going to add a 
sequential generator in the raftrandom package in order
to make writing test cases faster and easier
