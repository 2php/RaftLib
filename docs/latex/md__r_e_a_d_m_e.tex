\href{http://raftlib.io}{\tt Raft\+Lib} is a C++ Library for enabling stream/data-\/flow parallel computation. Using simple right shift operators (just like the C++ streams that you would use for string manipulation), you can link parallel compute kernels together. With Raft\+Lib, we do away with explicit use of pthreads, std\+::thread, Open\+MP, or any other parallel \char`\"{}threading\char`\"{} library. These are often mis-\/used, creating non-\/deterministic behavior. Raft\+Lib\textquotesingle{}s model allows lock-\/free F\+I\+F\+O-\/like access to the communications channels connecting each compute kernel. The full system has many auto-\/parallelization, optimization, and convenience features that enable relatively simple authoring of performant applications. This project is currently in the alpha stage (recently emerging from a PhD thesis). The beta release will bring back multi-\/node support, along with (planned) container support for the remote machines. Feel free to give it a shot, if you have any issues, also feel free to send the authors an e-\/mail. 



\subsubsection*{Build status}

\href{https://travis-ci.org/RaftLib/RaftLib}{\tt }

CI Test environment\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Linux -\/ kernel v. 3.\+13, Ubuntu 5.\+2.\+1-\/23ubuntu1$\sim$12.04, (gcc-\/5.\+2.\+1/\+Clang 3.\+7.\+1), C\+Make 3.\+5
\end{DoxyItemize}

Offline testing\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Linux -\/ kenrel v. 4.\+4, gcc-\/6.\+1/clang 3.\+8
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Pre-\/requisites}

\paragraph*{OS X \& Linux}

Compiler\+: c++14 capable -\/$>$ Clang, G\+NU G\+CC 5.\+0+, or Intel icc Libraries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Boost, if not installed, needed headers automatically downloaded with cmake
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Windows}

In progress

\subsubsection*{Install}

Make a build directory (for the instructions below, we\textquotesingle{}ll write \mbox{[}build\mbox{]}). If you want to build the Open\+CV example, then you\textquotesingle{}ll need to add to your cmake invocation\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
-DBUILD\_WOPENCV=true 
\end{DoxyCode}
 If you want to use the Scotch partitioning library (Unix/\+Linux) for partitioning kernel threads amongst physical resources, add the following config line to your cmake invocation\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
-DUSESCOTCH=1
\end{DoxyCode}


To use the \href{http://www.cs.sandia.gov/qthreads/}{\tt Q\+Threads User space H\+PC threading library} you will need to add the following (N\+O\+TE\+: The qthread library currently uses its own partitioner and does not work with Scotch, it also has issues with Open\+CV, will fix in next release iteration)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
-DUSEQTHREAD=1
\end{DoxyCode}


To build\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir [build]
cd [build]
cmake ..
make && make test
sudo make install
\end{DoxyCode}
 N\+O\+TE\+: The default prefix in the makefile is\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
PREFIX ?= /usr/local
\end{DoxyCode}
 Feel free to substitute your favorite build tool. I use Ninja and make depending on which machine I\textquotesingle{}m on. To change out, use cmake to generate the appropriate build files with the -\/\+Gxxx flag.

\subsubsection*{Random Notes}

The old Makefile had an uninstall script, I need to add an object to the cmake file so that we can have similar functionality. Theres also a bit of cleanup to do as I transition fully from Make to C\+Make.

A lot of the auto-\/optimization stuff has been pulled out temporarily while I\textquotesingle{}m working on cross-\/platform compatibility. A lot of the low level A\+PI calls are well, low level and Linux/\+Unix/\+OS X specific so I\textquotesingle{}m working on building in Windows versions of those specific calls. Should be done in a few weeks. ( 5 Jan 2016, jcb )

Added in prefetch for object types larger than a single cache line. Profiling shows that it\textquotesingle{}s really not beneficial on most platforms with good prefetch algorithms. (25 March 2016, jcb )
