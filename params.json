{"name":"Raft Light","tagline":"Simple, easy to use stream computation library for C++.","body":"### Welcome to the Raft Light C++ template library\r\nTo checkout the library do the following:\r\n```\r\n$ cd location_for_the_repo\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:jonathan-beard/RaftLight.git\r\n$ cd RaftLight\r\n$ git rm -rf fifo\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:jonathan-beard/templatedLockFreeFIFOQueue.git -b dev fifo\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you have all the files needed.  At the moment the system is in the beta phase, really designed\r\nfor research and hobby usage.  Eventually it'll have a proper build system.  At the moment \r\nhowever you'll have to do the following:\r\n```\r\n$ cd location_for_the_repo\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\nThis will generate the static library file _raftlight.a_.  Once this is built you're basically\r\nset save for a few details, which will be laid out within the tutorial as we build a simple\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2013 Jonathan Beard (@jonathan-beard) started work on the Raft language.  In the interim,\r\nand realizing the ubiquity of the C++ language, he started work on a template library that \r\nuses the same framework as the full Raft language and run-time system.  This C++ library is \r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n### Genealogy\r\nThere have been several dozen streaming languages.  Most notable of which is probably StreaMIT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
