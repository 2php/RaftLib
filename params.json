{"name":"RaftLib","tagline":"Simple, easy to use stream computation library for C++.","body":"### Welcome to the Raft C++ template library\r\n\r\n### Project Status\r\nThe Raft library is currently an alpha release, nearing its first beta.  The API itself is relatively stable, however the back end\r\nis subject to updates if needed (although we're taking pains to support needed old features). This software is subject to the Apache Version 2.0 license. The main-line branch is also the development branch. As new code is checked in, it is processed through two continuous integration services, the build status icon reflects the current Linux build and testsuite success. You can add applications to the main line through subsequent pull requests. There are also several releases, at this stage of the project, snapshots for releases are taken before any major changes. We plan on moving to a full beta release once the multi-node support is pulled from the research code and re-integrated with the mainline branch (at the current rate of development, that should be mid-March 2016). \r\n\r\n### Build Status\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-beard/RaftLib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-beard/RaftLib)\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nTo checkout the library and build RaftLib (along with all examples) do the following:\r\n```\r\n$ cd location_for_the_repo\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:jonathan-beard/RaftLib.git\r\n$ mkdir build\r\n$ cd build\r\n$ cmake ../RaftLib\r\n$ make & make test\r\n$ sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you would like to build the OpenCV example, add \r\n```bash\r\n-DBUILD_WOPENCV=true\r\n```\r\nto your cmake invocation, you will need a webcam or video source for it to work.\r\n\r\nThe make command will generate the static library file _libraft.a_, as well as test cases and all the example applications. These examples can be found in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd build/examples\r\n```  \r\n\r\nTo install the library to your system (in the default prefix), simply run \r\n```bash\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to build apps and use RaftLib\r\nWhen building an application using the library the only header file needed is the _raft_ header (see wiki for details), and you must link with the raft library file created during the compilation phase above. Many more details can be found in the following references (we'll endeavor to keep these up to date, but please feel free to contribute to the wiki or point out errors on our part):\r\n\r\n* [Project Wiki](https://github.com/jonathan-beard/RaftLib/wiki)\r\n* [Project README](https://github.com/jonathan-beard/RaftLib/blob/master/README.md)\r\n* [Blog post intro](https://goo.gl/4VDlbr)\r\n* [Jonathan Beard's thesis](http://goo.gl/obkWUh)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2013 Jonathan Beard (@jonathan-beard) started work on the Raft language.  In the interim,\r\nand realizing the ubiquity of the C++ language, he started work on a template library that \r\nuses the same framework as the full Raft language and run-time system.  This C++ library is \r\nthe result. Since then many have contributed to the theory and code base behind RaftLib (most\r\nnotable is my co-author (@pl53), for a full current contribution list see the GitHub stats page. \r\n\r\n### Genealogy\r\nThere have been several dozen streaming languages.  Most notable of which is probably StreaMIT.  I've worked on the Auto-Pipe streaming runtime system (both versions 1 and 2) developed at Washington University.  This particular streaming library was developed as a faster way to get started with stream processing by enabling users to stick to a language with which they are already familiar (C++).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe main source of documentation is available on the [RaftLib wiki page](https://github.com/jonathan-beard/RaftLib/wiki)\r\n\r\nIf you see errors, or want to contribute please feel free to do so. \r\n\r\n### Issues\r\nIssues can be opened by filing a report on our [issues page](https://github.com/jonathan-beard/RaftLib/issues)","google":"UA-55176313-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
